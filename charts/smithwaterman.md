# Smith-Waterman charts

All charts at 300 dpi.  Default size 10×8 inches; 1D plots also export
a 21×9 wide variant for the multi-CPG view.  GCUPs values are scaled
×8 to reflect all 8 pods (chip-wide; 1024 cores total).  Time/sequence
is in microseconds, log-scale.  cpg=2 omitted (most rows timed out at
launch scale; only one passed, not enough to draw a curve).

### `1d_allcpg_gcups_max.png` / `1d_allcpg_gcups_max_wide.png`

Same plot with a horizontal dashed line at the peak GCUPs across cpg ≥ 4
— every cpg ≥ 4 hits the same chip-wide peak (~31 GCUPs) at its own seq_len.

## 1D vs 2D — best per sequence length

Common sequence-length range only (sw/2d ceiling = 1024).

## Effect of high bandwidth

Slow-clock measurements scaled ×32 in time (project to a fast clock with
proportionally more DRAM bandwidth) → "high bandwidth".  Compute-bound
rows look identical to regular; memory-bound rows lift.

### `2d_effect_hibw.png`

Clear lift at small seq_len (memory-bound regime due to startup
overhead) — at seq_len=32 the chip-wide GCUPs jumps from 7.1 → 16.3
(~2.3× lift).  By seq_len=256 the curves overlap (compute-bound).

### `1d_effect_hibw.png`

Best-per-CPG slow rows only (the `sw1d_cpg_slow` filter sampled the
largest seq_len per CPG, so this comparison is sparse — 4 points at
the (cpg, seq_len) pairs that have both fast and slow data).  Regular
and high-bandwidth land on top of each other → sw/1d is compute-bound
at every measured configuration.
